# Corrade

`Corrade` is a multi-purpose, multi-platform scripted agent (bot) that runs
under Windows or Unix natively, as a service or daemon whilst staying connected
to a Linden-based grid (either Second Life or OpenSim) and controlled entirely
by scripts. We like to think of Corrade as a bridge, that gives access to
viewer-commands to LSL scripts. Corrade does not stop at providing viewer-commands
to LSL scripts but reaches into the Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data and
Artificial Intelligence (AI) by implementing the latest technologies and
communication protocols. Corrade's target audience consists of programmers
that will use Corrade as a building block and then create an end-product.

The scripts in this repository are original scripting by Truth & Beauty Lab
along with modified versions of scripts distributed under an Open Source
license found at:
