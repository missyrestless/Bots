# Corrade Masters

The following is a Corrade 10 equivalent of the masters setting in Corrade 9 - when configured, the template will accept any inventory item, permission request or teleport lure from the owner of this template.

## Setup

The script comes with a configuration notecard that can be used to set various parameters. The template requires the `inventory` and `notifications` permission as well as the `inventory`, `permission` and `lure` notifications to be enabled using Nucleus.
